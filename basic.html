            <h2 id="section1">Introduction</h2>
            Welcome to our first module on programming. In this module, we will
be discussing the nuts and bolts of the Python programming language
ranging from the very basic to more advanced topics.
Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming more
and more popular for<br>
• performing data analysis,<br>
• automating tasks,<br>
• learning data science,<br>
• machine learning, etc.<br>
            <h2 id="section2">DATA STRUCTURE</h2>
             <pr>  In this section we will learn about various built-in data structures such as
tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets. Like a variable, data structures are also
used to store a value. Unlike a variable, they don’t just store a value, rather
a collection of values in various formats. Broadly data structures are divided into array, list and file. Arrays can be considered a basic form of data
structure while files are more advanced to store complex data.</pr>
            <h2 id="section3">FUNCTION</h2>
            Let’s now explore this remarkably handy feature seen in almost all
programming languages: functions. There are lots of fantastic in-built
functions in Python and its ecosystem. However, often, we as a Python
programmer need to write custom functions to solve problems that are
unique to our needs. Here is the definition of a function.
A function is a block of code(that performs a specific task) which runs only when it
is called.<br><br>
